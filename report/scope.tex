This study is explores a reputation based approach to scaling proof-of-work puzzle difficulties, thereby covering necessary theory of puzzle-based mechanisms specifically hash-reversal based puzzles. Furthermore, the study aims to cover explainations of the implemented protocol, simulation experiments and results of significance. 

There is various types of proof-of-work protocols as of recently. Hence, the study does not specifically aim to cover these but might be mentioned throughout the paper.
