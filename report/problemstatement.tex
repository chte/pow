With the problem defined the question at hand is thus if it is possible to develop a Proof of Work protocol that is independent of client characteristics.
\begin{itemize}
\item Is there a viable way to implement a Proof of Work system so that the system's resources are accessable by a diverse variety of devices?

\item How should the protocol be optimised for low impact on legitimate client behaviour and high impact on malicious behaviour?

\item What advantages and disadvantages does proof of work concept bring in practice and in which applications could it be an improvement to current security?
\end{itemize}
