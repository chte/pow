\subsubsection{Arithmetic Averages Have a Bit of Magic}
That bit of magic is the \emph{Central Limit Theorem}. In our case the result data will be based of samples of test data with an unknown distribution. The central limit theorem tells us that no matter how the data is distributed the sampled distribution to estimate our means will not matter if the sample size is large $(n > 30)$.
