The Internet continues to grow and has since a time back fulfilled it's early promise to enable a single source to be connected to several millions of geographically dispersed computers. However, as a consequence it has introduced security flaws of a new magnitude, allowing a single computer to potentially be attacked by millions of sources at once. 

This threat also known as denial-of-service\footnote{For a more indept introduction to Denial of Service attacks please see section \ref{text:dos}} (DoS) attacks is a growing concern as these attacks have shown to disable even well-known services. Unlike other attacks the primary goal of denial of service attacks is to restrict or disrupt the availability of the service to its legitimate users. It is essentially a targeted effort to prevent a service from functioning properly by draining the underlying computer resources. 

One attempt to counter DoS attacks and to improve service survivability is a computational approach called Proof of Work (PoW)\footnote{For a more indept introduction to Proof of Work please see section \ref{text:pow}}. Proof of Work also known as \emph{Client Puzzles}\cite{dosauth, JuelsB99} is cryptographic in flavor and requires the clients to solve an instance of a predefined problem in order to gain access to the server’s resources.


In this paper, we examine the use of reputation based scaling of Proof of Work problem difficulties to mitigate various DoS attacks. We propose a new Reputation Based Proof of Work protection protocol (RB-PoW). The protocol was implemented via an experimental architecture and tested with a web-based simulation interface.

This reduces the total number of requests that reach the content server in any given timeframe to a level l. l could be tuned to a level lower than the server’s inherent threshold of requests able to execute in said timeframe.
