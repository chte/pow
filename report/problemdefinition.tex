Proof of Work has been shown to potentially work as a prevention mechanism to at least mitigate the effects of a DoS attack without making an as assumption about the source.[k√§lla] However, Laurie and Clayton concluded in the paper \citetitle{laurieandclayton}, that PoW on it's own, is not a feasible solution to fighting spam and denial of service attacks. This is because the classical implementation of Proof of Work does not seperate legitimate users from attackers. Hence, problems from a Proof of Work protected system would not discourage abusers of the system without having an unacceptable effect on legitimate users. 

This was not that was unthought of when Proof of Work was first proposed.
