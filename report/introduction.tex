Denial of Service continues to plague internet services, as evidenced by the recent attack on Spamhaus \cite{BBC}

It is essentially a targeted effort to prevent a service from functioning properly by draining the underlying computer resources. Such an attack is executed by having each attacking machine performing only small load of total work, relying on the cumulative work to overload target system.

This paper focuses on Proof of Work, a concept originally proposed by Dwork and Naor in their report \citetitle{dworkandnaor}, as an approach to fighting denial of service attacks. The ''proof of work'' is cryptographic in flavor and the idea is essentially to respond with a problem that is moderately hard to compute but easy to verify. Dwork and Naor originally called this a \emph{pricing function} because of it's economic origin. They introduced this concept as a way to fight e-mail spam by increasing the costs of sending spam, thus making e-mail spam economically unfeasible.
%One of the most significant threats in server security are Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. It is essentially a targeted effort to prevent a service from functioning properly by draining the underlying computer resources. There are different levels of the attacks which either can be targeted to exploit vulnerabilities in the  TCP/IP-protocol, in the operation system that the server runs on or more specific implementations of the service.

%Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in the Proof of Work (PoW) concept in order to prevent or mitigate the effects of a DoS attack on such a system. The idea is to require the clients to solve an instance of a predefined problem in order to gain access to the server’s resources. To cope with a potential DoS attacks the level of difficulty of the problems is scaled proportionally with the amount stress that is put on the system. [källa på det här]

This reduces the total number of requests that reach the content server in any given timeframe to a level l. l could be tuned to a level lower than the server’s inherent threshold of requests able to execute in said timeframe.
