This study explores a reputation based approach to scaling proof-of-work puzzle difficulties, thereby covering necessary theory of puzzle-based mechanisms specifically hash-reversal based puzzles. Furthermore, the study aims to cover explanations of the implemented protocol, simulation experiments and results of significance. 

There is various types of proof-of-work protocols as of recently. Hence, the study does not specifically aim to cover these but might be mentioned throughout the paper. Various types of denial-of-service attacks exists, some which aim to disable lower level layers. This paper is limited to DoS attacks on application level layer by technical reasons. Otherwise, a proof-of-work scheme can be circumvented by an attack on a lower abstraction layer\footnote{Application layer and abstraction layer of the OSI model}.
