Since one requirement of a Proof of Work system is that it minimises differences between a wide variety of devices appearing in the wild we needed to support both desktop and laptops with different operating systems as well as cellphones and tablets.
In order to minimise the development effort and maximise maintainability of the code base, a multi platform solution was sought for the client part of the demo application. 

A web based solution makes the perfect portable application, however the web is not stateful by default and quite badly imitates an application server which keeps a constantly open socket connection with connected clients. The advent of websockets turn the whole thing around, with the help of those nice fellas we were able to write a truly multi-platform PoW client in html and javascript which maintains the generality and plasticity of a natively written socket based application. 

For the server side we choose to use Googles novel programming language go(\Titlecite{golang})
