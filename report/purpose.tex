The purpose of this study is to research ways to improve the classical Proof of Work in such a way that legitimate users are less affected by the Proof of Work than the participants of a DoS attack. Furthermore to find a way to dynamically scale the required proof of work when dealing with different hardware.

A PoW difficulty scaling model is developed and its performance is measured against a naive CPU load difficulty scaler. To support the testing, a Proof of Work testing framework is designed and implemented.% Service time for each request is measured
