The global difficulty could potentially work as a prevention mechanism to at least mitigate the effects of a DoS attack without making an as assumption about the source. However, this is also what brings the current implementations of Proof of Work to it's knees. The classical implementation of Proof of Work does not seperate legitimate users from attackers. Hence, a Proof of Work protected system under stress would also send hard problems to legitimate users resulting in long response times. This also affects users that access the system with devices equipped weaker hardware in terms of performance, i.e. mobile devices and computers with out of date hardware, which then would require more effort to solve the problems.
