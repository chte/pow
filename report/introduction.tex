One of the most significant threats in server security are Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. It is essentially a targeted effort to prevent a service from functioning properly by draining the underlying computer resources. There are different levels of the attacks which either can be targeted to exploit vulnerabilities in the  TCP/IP-protocol, in the operation system that the server runs on or more specific implementations of the service.

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in the Proof of Work (PoW) concept in order to prevent or mitigate the effects of a DoS attack on such a system. The idea is to require the clients to solve an instance of a predefined problem to gain access to the server’s resources. The solving of the problem would decrease the rate that each client would be able to issue requests to the server. This reduces the total number of requests that reach the content server in any given timeframe to a level l. l could be tuned to a level lower than the server’s inherent threshold of requests able to execute in said timeframe.
